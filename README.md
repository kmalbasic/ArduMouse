# ArduMouse
Simulating mouse inputs through LAN using Arduino

# How does it work?
Your receiver computer needs to have Arduino Leonardo attached to it, with the selected sketch uploaded onto it. Transmitter
computer will have the mouse connected and will send all the mouse movements/clicks to the receiver. Whole point of this project
is to manipulate the main mouse movements through Arduino do avoid some limitations when it comes to gamehacking.

# Requirements:
- Arduino Leonardo
- Transmitter PC
- Receiver PC

# How to use it?
Compile both programs, run the receiver program on the receiver PC and transmitter program on transmitter PC. Modify the program
if you want to. Profit?
